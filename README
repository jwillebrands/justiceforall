This addon will remind you to pick up Badges of Justice.

Type /badge or /jfa to show the frame to reposition it. Right click to hide it again.

**Changelog
Beta -> 1.0
* Changed to own frame instead of using LowHealthFrame. LHF was annoying and sometimes not as noticeable as I want it to be.
* Should be free of bugs now.
